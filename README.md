## Please read before using Blok.bg:
To try out the project, and see how an already made group works, register with code 1165 as the building code.
If you register with another code, you will create another separate group. The last 2 or 3 numbers of the building code are the building's number.
If you want to register as an admin (домоуправител), use the same building code and whatever PIN you want (max length is 5 characters.)

## General info

who want to communicate in their own space. It is possible to add a user,
